SDIM is the abbreviation for Secure Decentralized Instant Messaging.<br>
SDIM is built to offer a simple, secure and privacy respecting alternative to centralized messaging services like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal or Threema.<br><br>
With SDIM you are part of the XMPP federated network and hosting your own XMPP node. Therefore you should install your SDIM node at a reliable internet connection for the best user experience.<br><br>
If the above mentioned messaging services are secure, there is still metadata collected by the services in a centralized manner. SDIM tries to circumvent situations where metadata about your chats can be collected at network level.<br><br>
SDIM is based on Debian Linux, Tor, Prosody IM and some web technology.
